## How to get API Keys

To use SheetDB's global endpoints, you have to authenticate yourself using API key.

You can create an API key here: [https://sheetdb.io/app/api-keys](https://sheetdb.io/app/api-keys). API keys are used to identify and authorize you when you make a request to SheetDB's API. You can create API keys with different permissions depending on your needs. We recommend that you grant as little permission as necessary to your API keys.

Once you have created an API key with the required permissions, you can include it in your HTTP requests. To include the API key in the URL, you can use the following format:

`https://sheetdb.io/api/v1/{APP_ID}/{API_KEY}/list`

Replace `{APP_ID}` and `{API_KEY}` with your APP ID and API key.

<Note>
    Including the API key in the URL is a convenient way to authenticate yourself when making requests to SheetDB's global endpoints. However, **be careful not to share your API key with others**, as anyone with your API key can access your data.
