# Maximum Request Body Size

In this guide, we will discuss the maximum request body size allowed when working with the SheetDB API. Understanding this limitation is crucial for ensuring your requests are processed successfully. {{ className: 'lead' }}

The maximum request body size that can be sent to SheetDB is **8 MB**. This means the total size of the data sent in a single HTTP request, including headers and content, must not exceed this limit. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Chunk Large Data

If you need to send large datasets, consider breaking them into smaller chunks and sending multiple requests, ensuring each request stays within the 8 MB limit. {{ className: 'lead' }}
