# SheetDB Documentation

SheetDB is a tool that will turn your Google Spreadsheet into a JSON API. In this documentation you will find everything you need to know about the SheetDB API. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact us. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<div className="not-prose mb-16 mt-6 flex gap-3">
  <Button href="/quickstart" arrow="right" children="Quickstart" />
  <Button href="/sheetdb-api/read" variant="outline" children="Explore our API" />
</div>

## Getting started {{ anchor: false }}

To get started, create a new API in your [dashboard](https://sheetdb.io/app/apis), then make sure your spreadsheet is in the correct format - column names should be in the first row. After creating the API, you will receive a unique ID.

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button
    href="/quickstart#making-your-first-api-request"
    variant="text"
    arrow="right"
    children="Make your first request"
  />
