# What is a request

Every time an application queries SheetDB for the contents of a spreadsheet or requests changes to it, a request is made. If you're using a CRM to send email campaigns, usually every email is a request. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Enabling the cache does not affect the way requests are counted. Cache only affects the speeding up of responses and bypassing other [limits](/limits). {{ className: 'lead' }}
